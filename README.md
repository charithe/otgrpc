gRPC Opentracing Interceptors For Golang
========================================

An (experimental) attempt to use [Opentracing](http://opentracing.io/) with [gRPC](http://grpc.io) services. The official
[grpc-opentracing](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-opentracing) project is the best source for a production-ready implementation.
This library attempts to add tracing to gRPC streams as well -- which may very well be a fool's errand.
